### All algorithms implemented in Python (for education)

These implementations are for learning purposes. They may be efficient than the implementations in the Python standard library.

## Contribution Guidelines

* File name should be in camel case.
* Write proper documentation of the code.
* Avoid input methods as far as possible. Assign values to the variables statically. This will make the code easy to understand and algorithm can be traced easily.
* Add a corresponding explaination to [Algorithms-Explanation](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Algorithms-Explanation) (Optional but recommended).
* Avoid importing external libraries for basic algorithms.
