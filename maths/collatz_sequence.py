    Collatz conjecture: start with any positive integer n.Next termis obtained from the previous term as follows: 
    if the previous term is even, the next term is one half the previous term. 
    If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous term plus 1. 
    The conjecture states the sequence will always reach 1 regaardess of starting n.
    Example:
    >>> collatz_sequence(43)
