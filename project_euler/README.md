# ProjectEuler

Problems are taken from https://projecteuler.net/.

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that will require more than just mathematical
insights to solve. Project Euler is ideal for mathematicians who are learning to code.

Here the efficiency of your code is also checked.
I've tried to provide all the best possible solutions.
